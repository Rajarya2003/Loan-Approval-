# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan approval status using machine learning techniques. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, feature engineering, and building a classification model. By combining domain insights with robust algorithms, the project aims to enhance the understanding of factors influencing loan approvals.

## Features of the Project
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Detailed analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and missing values.
   - Visualization of key features affecting loan approval decisions.

2. **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**
   - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features.
   - Creating meaningful new features to improve model performance.

3. **Model Development**
   - Implementation of a Random Forest Classifier to predict loan approval.
   - Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Steps in the Project
1. **EDA**
   - Initial understanding of the dataset.
   - Visualizing trends and distributions to gain insights.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**
   - Cleaning and transforming raw data.
   - Engineering new features based on domain knowledge.

3. **Model Building**
   - Training a Random Forest model.
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy and performance metrics using the Random Forest model.
- Key insights into features that strongly influence loan approvals.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
