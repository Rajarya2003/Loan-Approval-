# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is focused on predicting loan approval status using a combination of machine learning techniques and comprehensive data preprocessing. The key objective is to create a robust classification model capable of accurately predicting loan approvals based on applicant information.

The project follows a systematic approach, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing and feature engineering, class balancing using SMOTE, and building a Random Forest model for predictions.

---

## Features of the Project

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analysis of the dataset to understand distributions, detect missing values, and identify relationships between variables.
   - Visualizations to uncover trends and patterns affecting loan approval decisions.

2. **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:**
   - Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
   - Standardizing numerical features to improve model performance.
   - Creating new features based on domain knowledge for better predictions.

3. **Class Balancing with SMOTE:**
   - Addressing class imbalance in the dataset by applying Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).

4. **Random Forest Classifier Model:**
   - Building and training a Random Forest model.
   - Hyperparameter tuning and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Key Steps in the Project

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized correlations and feature distributions.
   - Identified missing values and patterns in the data.
   - Analyzed relationships between features and the target variable (loan approval).

### 2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:**
   - **Handling Missing Values:** Used strategies such as mean/median imputation for numerical variables and mode imputation for categorical variables.
   - **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converted categorical variables to numerical using one-hot encoding and label encoding.
   - **Scaling Numerical Features:** Applied Min-Max Scaling to standardize numerical variables.
   - **Feature Engineering:** Created additional features to capture underlying relationships in the data.

### 3. **Class Balancing:**
   - Applied **SMOTE** to balance the class distribution in the target variable, ensuring that the model learns effectively for both approved and rejected loans.

### 4. **Random Forest Classifier:**
   - Trained a Random Forest model for classification.
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the model.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results and Achievements

- **Model Performance:** The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy and balanced performance across metrics, handling the initial class imbalance effectively.
- **Feature Importance:** Gained insights into the most influential features for predicting loan approvals.
- **SMOTE Impact:** Demonstrated improved model learning by addressing class imbalance.
